# Cortex presentation for an English teacher

Imagine if your students could learn English while helping to preserve a millennia-old language…

Cortex is an open-source educational platform that uses AI and gamification to revitalize Indigenous languages, especially Yucatec Maya. But beyond preservation, it’s an innovative pedagogical tool that can transform language teaching.

**The educational challenge**
- An Indigenous language disappears every 2 weeks.
- Young Maya lose their language in favor of Spanish/English.
- Lack of engaging, adapted teaching tools.
- Intergenerational gap in transmission.

**Our approach**
- Bidirectional learning: Maya ↔ English/Spanish
- Immersive, research-backed methods
- Culturally adapted gamification
- Bridging oral tradition and modern technology

**Key pedagogical features**
1. Authentic audio corpus (native speakers, traditional stories, AI pronunciation exercises, interactive transcripts)
2. Contextualized learning (real-life situations, culture-based vocabulary, comparative grammar, idioms)
3. Teacher tools (custom learning paths, progress tracking, downloadable resources, ongoing Maya linguistics training)
4. Student engagement (family challenges, culturally relevant rewards, collaborative projects, student-created content)

**Concrete applications**
- “English through Maya Eyes” module: linguistic comparison, vocabulary enrichment, metalinguistic awareness
- Intercultural projects: pen-pal with Maya schools, collaborative translation, oral tradition documentation
- 21st-century skills: digital citizenship, heritage preservation, collaboration, critical thinking about linguistic diversity

**Measurable impact**
- +40% student motivation with cultural learning
- Better understanding of language structures
- Development of intercultural empathy
- Valuing multilingualism

**2025 goals**
- 20 pilot schools (Yucatán + international)
- 500 active students
- 100h of educational content
- 10 cross-learning modules

**Collaboration opportunities**
- Pedagogical advisor (module design, validation, teacher training)
- Educational ambassador (presentations, networking, feedback)
- Co-creation of content (Maya-English exercises, guides, assessment)
- Action research (classroom impact studies, joint publications, conferences)

**Quick demo**
Example: lesson on numbers (audio of Maya grandmother counting, visualization of vigesimal vs decimal systems, “Memory” game in 3 languages, family challenge)

**Long-term vision**
Cortex = a lab for pedagogical innovation, a replicable model for 300+ endangered languages, training a generation of “language guardians”, bridging traditional knowledge and modernity.
