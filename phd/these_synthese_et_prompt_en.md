# Global project, thesis and AI prompt synthesis (EN)

## 1. Detailed presentation of the “Cortex” project

**Objective**
Create an antifragile, modular, and community-driven system for the preservation, analysis, and transmission of languages and knowledge, integrating:
- Automated resource ingestion (monitoring, scraping, API, orality)
- Enrichment and annotation by AI and the community
- Advanced monitoring (scientific, dreamlike, ritual metrics, etc.)
- Open governance and multi-AI/human dialogue
- Living, versioned, and traceable documentation
- Hybrid transmission: written, oral, ritual, post-digital

**Architecture**
- Independent modules: cortex (cognitive assistant), veilleur (ingestion), monitoring, documentation, AI connectors
- Centralized activation/deactivation (`config.json`)
- Separate logging, configurable confidentiality
- REST/WS API for access, contribution, visualization
- Dashboard (web, Grafana, Metabase, etc.) for monitoring and analysis
- Living documentation (README, wiki, changelog, guides)
- Open to contribution (issues, PR, guide, rituals)

**Main flows**
- Veilleur collects and enriches resources (text, audio, web, etc.)
- Cortex and AI facilitate analysis, synthesis, transmission
- Monitoring collects metrics (usage, transmission, mutations, etc.)
- API and dashboard expose data, documentation, contributions
- The community (humans and AI) enriches, corrects, transmits, documents

## 2. Detailed presentation of the thesis (template)

**Title (example)**
Towards an antifragile and community-driven system for the living preservation and transmission of languages: architecture, protocols, and multi-AI governance

**Problem statement**
How to design a technical and methodological system that:
- Survives and improves in the face of uncertainty (antifragility, post-digital)
- Enables the collection, analysis, and transmission of multi-format resources (written, oral, ritual, etc.)
- Integrates AI and the community in governance, enrichment, documentation
- Facilitates contribution, traceability, scientific reproducibility
- Adapts to various contexts (individual, collective, infrastructure, fieldwork)

**Axes**
- Modular architecture, on-demand activation, scalability
- Protocols for monitoring, ingestion, annotation, transmission
- Multi-AI/human governance, constructive dialogue, transmission rituals
- Advanced metrics (dreamlike, somatic, community, etc.)
- Living documentation, living lab, openness to contribution

## 3. AI prompt for refining the theme, problem statement, finding resources and universities

```
You are an expert assistant in interdisciplinary research (language sciences, AI, digital humanities, ethnolinguistics, software engineering, open governance).

Project leader profile:
- Experience in designing multilingual, self-improving, open, and secure documentary and application systems.
- Dual expertise in language didactics (CEFR/FLE, indigenous languages) and digital/AI innovation.
- Practice in automation, open source AI, collective human–AI governance, and community openness.
- Sensitivity to ethics, confidentiality, co-construction, and valuing human and AI contributions.
- Ability to lead interdisciplinary projects, document, innovate, and open research to the community.

Here is the project:
- Antifragile, modular, community-driven system for the living preservation, analysis, and transmission of languages (written, oral, ritual, post-digital)
- AI integration (enrichment, annotation, multi-agent dialogue), advanced monitoring, living documentation, open governance
- Objectives: robustness, openness, transmission, scientific reproducibility, adaptation to uncertainty

Your mission:
1. Help me refine the theme, subject, and problem statement of my thesis (originality, impact, feasibility, interdisciplinarity)
2. Propose research axes, key questions, suitable methodologies
3. Suggest scientific resources, articles, books, similar projects, databases, conferences
4. Provide criteria to valorize the project (social, scientific, technological, ethical impact)
5. Recommend relevant universities, laboratories, or thesis supervisors (France, Europe, international)
6. Suggest ways to strengthen the community, ritual, or post-digital dimension

Feel free to ask questions to better target, and to propose reformulations or innovative angles.
