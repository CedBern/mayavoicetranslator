# Empowering communities through culturally-adapted digital governance

**Source: Claude, 2025 – Synthesis for MayaVoiceTranslator & VocesAncestrales**

This guide summarizes key findings and recommendations from a global review of 100+ community digital governance initiatives (Indigenous, Global South, marginalized populations). It covers:

- Community-controlled digital governance (OCAP®, Te Mana Raraunga, Mukurtu, etc.)
- Conflict resolution: hybrid mediation (Cowichan, Nigeria, NZ, UNHCR lessons)
- Technical knowledge: mentorship, living documentation, peer learning (First Nations Tech Council, Mukurtu, PolArctic AI)
- Security education: cultural metaphors, holistic approaches (Tactical Tech, Project Cipher, U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network)
- Onboarding: co-design, visual consent, multilingual/cultural adaptation (Mukurtu, Berlin Privacy Icons, UNHCR Digital Gateway)
- Economic models: platform/data cooperatives, Indigenous ISPs, participatory budgeting (Fairbnb, Mohawk Networks, Healthbank, mesh networks)

## Key Success Patterns
- **Community sovereignty**: Real power over data, tech, and decisions
- **Cultural integration**: Tech adapted to local values, not just translated
- **Diversified funding**: Grants + member fees + institutional support
- **Technical capacity**: Partnerships, mentorship, living documentation

## Recommendations for MayaVoiceTranslator
- Integrate OCAP®/FPIC principles for data governance and consent
- Use hybrid conflict resolution (traditional + digital mediation)
- Develop mentorship and living documentation for technical training
- Use visual, metaphor-based security education and onboarding
- Co-design onboarding and interfaces with community, not just translate
- Plan for hybrid economic models (cooperative, participatory budgeting, etc.)
- Document all governance and onboarding processes for auditability
