# Community Trust Communication Kit

## 1. Transparency
- Clearly present the project’s objectives, guarantees (security, sovereignty, consent), and limitations.
- Share documentation, architecture diagrams, guides, and roadmaps with the community.
- Organize public demonstrations (sandbox, videos, workshops) with fictitious data.

## 2. Collective Process
- Involve the community at every key stage (consultation, validation, co-design, testing).
- Propose a clear validation process (vote, consensus, community agreement signature).
- Document and publish collective decisions (minutes, reports, recordings).

## 3. Listening and Dialogue
- Set up feedback channels (meetings, forums, surveys, direct contacts).
- Take into account concerns, suggestions, and needs, and respond publicly.
- Adapt the project based on feedback, and explain the choices made.

## 4. Proof of Technical Capacity
- Demonstrate feasibility via a sandbox, mockups, automated tests, without real data collection.
- Explain how security, confidentiality, and sovereignty are technically guaranteed.
- Publish the results of audits, tests, and community validations.

## 5. Right of Withdrawal and Adaptability
- Guarantee at all times the community’s right to withdraw or modify the project.
- Provide mechanisms for suspension or evolution of the project according to collective will.

**Advice:**
- Regularly remind that technology is at the service of the community, never the other way around.
- Value collective achievements and co-construction at every stage.

This kit can be adapted, translated, and shared at every phase of the project to strengthen trust and engagement.
