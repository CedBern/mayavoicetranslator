 * =================================================================================================
 * TRAINING WORKER
 * =================================================================================================
 * 
 * This worker is responsible for handling the intensive computational tasks of training, fine-tuning,
 * and evaluating neural network models for translation, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Automatic Speech
 * Recognition (ASR) for Mayan languages.
 * 
 * It is designed to be spawned as a separate process by the main Node.js application (e.g., using
 * child_process.fork) to avoid blocking the main event loop. This ensures the API server remains
 * responsive to user requests while training is in progress.
 * 
 * The worker communicates with the main process (CustomMayaModelTrainer.js) via IPC (Inter-Process
 * Communication) to receive training tasks and report progress, logs, and results.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * --------------------
 * 1.  **Receive Training Jobs:** Listens for 'start-training' messages from the parent process.
 *     Each job contains the model type (translation, TTS, ASR), language, dataset paths,
 *     hyperparameters, and other configuration.
 * 
 * 2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Loads and preprocesses the specified datasets (e.g., from MinIO)
 *     using culturally and linguistically appropriate tokenization, normalization, and feature
 *     extraction techniques. It leverages modules like `PhoneticProcessor.js`.
 * 
 * 3.  **Model Training:**
 *     - Uses libraries like TensorFlow.js (for Node.js), PyTorch (via PythonShell), or Hugging Face
 *       Transformers (via a Python bridge) to execute the training loop.
 *     - Implements the core logic for training different model architectures (e.g., Transformers,
 *       Tacotron2, Wav2Vec2).
 * 
 * 4.  **Progress & Logging:** Periodically sends 'progress' messages back to the parent,
 *     including epoch number, loss, accuracy, and other metrics. This allows the main application
 *     to monitor the training status in real-time.
 * 
 * 5.  **Model Saving:** Upon successful training, saves the model artifacts (weights, configs,
 *     vocabularies) to a specified location, typically the MinIO object storage for persistence
 *     and versioning.
 * 
 * 6.  **Completion/Error Handling:** Sends a 'done' message with the path to the trained model
 *     or an 'error' message if the training fails, including a detailed error report.
 * 
 * This architecture ensures that the computationally heavy lifting of model training is
 * isolated, making the system scalable and robust.
